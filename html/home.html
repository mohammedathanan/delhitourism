<br><br>
<font size="5">Delhi is the heart of the nation.<br>No, I
should say that 'Dilli is Dil' of our nation and the slogan that 'Dilli dilwalon Ki' is true in every sense.<br>
The throbbing metropolitan has been a place of importance in Indian History. Be it known as the
Indraprastha in the times of Mahabharat or Delhi as we know it today; it has been there; witnessing
the most crucial and detrimental events in the history of mankind. Hence, the place is etched with
loads of historical monuments, places of archaeological importance, parks, gardens, and educational
institutions which attract the attention of the travellers as well as the residents.<br>
While in and around Delhi, you can rest assured that every instinct of yours which is associated with
travelling will be answered to properly and will be reciprocated in such a manner that you will nd
yourself drawn to it times and again. <br>We have brought to you, the list of best places to visit in Delhi
which will make your tour worth of its time in every sense.<br></font>
<br>
<font color="red" size="6" face="algerian"><u><a name="red">Red Fort</a></u></font>
<br><br>
<center><a href="Capture.jpg"><img src="Capture.jpg" ></a></center><br>
<font size="5">Red Fort is one of the most iconic forts in the nation which is still functioning as the venue for
Independence Day celebrations. <br>The fort is open as a tourist attraction and has various other places
of tourist interest in its proximity. The fort entrance has a small market of handicrafts, bags,
accessories and other items which are really colourful and bustling with people all the times.<br> The
Red Fort is one of the best tourist places in Delhi and is closed for tourists on Mondays.<br>

<br>
<font color="#ce9b00" size="6" face="algerian"><u>Humayun's Tomb</u></font><br><br>
<center><a href="hh.jpg"><img src="hh.jpg" ></a></center><br>
<font size="5">Humayun's Tomb is one of the best tourist places in Delhi. <p>The monument was built in 1570 under
the supervision of Queen Haji Begum in the memory of her husband Humayun. The architecture of
the tomb is Persian and resembles that of the Taj Mahal. It is open for visits on all days.
</font>
<br><br>
<font color="#ce9b00" size="6" face="algerian"><u><a name="q">Qutab Minar</a></u></font><br><br>
<center><a href="WH1.jpg"><img src="WH1.jpg" ></a></center><br>
<font size="5">The main Minar, as well as the other places and attractions, are imbibed in a complex
which is known as the Qutab complex. Believed to be constructed by Qutab-ud-Din Aibak, the 73-meter tall tower has been featured in lots of movies. The place is peaceful and enigmatic. You can nd the tourists, architecture students sketching the perspective views and lots of other people roaming in the complex and still never feel crowded. I have always loved this place from among all the other ones
and have spent various long evenings in the quiet corners of the Qutab Minar</font>
<br><br>
<font color="blue" size="6" face="algerian"><u>INDIA GATE</u></font><br><br>
<center><a href="in.jpg"><img src="in.jpg" ></a></center><br>
<font size="5">Erected in the memory of the 70, 000 soldiers killed in the Afghan War and World War I,
 the war memorial was completed in 1931. 
The place is an enigmatic one and transforms into a place teeming with life. Hundreds of people visit the India Gate in the evening and night and spend a lovely time with friends and family. 
This is a must do outing while touring Delhi.</font>
